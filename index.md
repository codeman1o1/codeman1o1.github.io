Welcome to C-site!

## My projects

Almost every (if not all) project will show a message regarding about that the file is not safe. My projects are safe as long as you download them from my website.
The reason why your browser or Windows is showing you this message is because of the following reasons:

1. The file is not commonly downloaded
2. The file is not verified because that costs a lot of money

* [ABC formula solver](assets/files/abc-formula_solver.exe)
